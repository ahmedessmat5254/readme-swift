# readme-swift
This app was created based on AMAZING tutorial on [raywenderlich.com - Your Second iOS and SwiftUI App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/15234721-your-second-ios-and-swiftui-app)
I learned a ton from it! The final result is this app where you can manage a collection of books. You can:
- Add a new book (title, author, review and and image).
- Delete a book.
- Sort books by title or author.
- Manually sort books.

The app supports light and dark mode.
